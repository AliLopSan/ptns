# ptns
A repository for the generation of Perfect Transfer Networks (PTNs)

## What are Perfect Transfer Networks?
**Perfect Transfer Networks** also called PTNs [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13015-023-00242-2?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20240206&utm_content=10.1186/s13015-023-00242-2) are a character-based model for the inference of Horizontal Gene Transfer events. How do they work? Well, it all starts with:

This representations allows us to find horizontal gene transfers (HGTs):
